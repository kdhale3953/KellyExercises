Challenge one:

To add xy coordinates:

here is some example code:

# Name: AddXY_Example.py
# Description: Adds X and Y coordinates to a coverage's point attribute table
# Requirements: ArcInfo Workstation

# Import system modules
import arcinfo
import arcpy
from arcpy import env

# Set environment settings
env.workspace = "C:/data"

# Set local variables
inCover = "wells"
featureType = "POINT"

#Execute AddXY
arcpy.AddXY_arc(inCover, featureType)


The parameters that are required are:

in_cover The coverage containing points or polygon labels whose x,y coordinates will become attributes in the PAT, or in the coverage containing nodes, to the NAT.
 Coverage 
 feature_type
 (Optional) Type of coverage feature whose x,y coordinates will become feature attributes.

 POINT —Point feature coordinates to be added to the PAT including label points. This is the default option. 
 NODE —Node feature coordinates to be added to the NAT. 
  String
