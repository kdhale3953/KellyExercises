Challenge one:

To add xy coordinates:

here is some example code:

# Name: AddXY_Example.py
# Description: Adds X and Y coordinates to a coverage's point attribute table
# Requirements: ArcInfo Workstation

# Import system modules
import arcinfo
import arcpy
from arcpy import env

# Set environment settings
env.workspace = "C:/data"

# Set local variables
inCover = "wells"
featureType = "POINT"

#Execute AddXY
arcpy.AddXY_arc(inCover, featureType)


The parameters that are required are:

in_cover The coverage containing points or polygon labels whose x,y coordinates will become attributes in the PAT, or in the coverage containing nodes, to the NAT.
 Coverage 
 feature_type
 (Optional) Type of coverage feature whose x,y coordinates will become feature attributes.

 POINT —Point feature coordinates to be added to the PAT including label points. This is the default option. 
 NODE —Node feature coordinates to be added to the NAT. 
  String 

The dissolve tool can be accessed by using the following code as an example:

# Name: Dissolve_Example.py
# Description: Dissolves polygons into larger sections
# Requirements: ArcInfo Workstation

# Import system modules
import arcpy
from arcpy import env

# Set environment settings
env.workspace = "C:/data"

# Set local variables
inCover = "tra_airport"
outCover = "C:/output/airport_sect"
dissolveItem = "section"
featureType = "POLY"

# Execute Dissolve
arcpy.Dissolve_arc(inCover, outCover, dissolveItem, featureType)
  

The required parameters are:

in_cover The coverage containing features to be dissolved.
 Coverage 
 out_cover The coverage to be created. The output coverage cannot already exist.
  Coverage 
  dissolve_item The item in the in_cover feature attribute table that is used to dissolve features.

  Dissolve_item—An item name will be used to perform the dissolve. The item may be a redefined item. 
  #ALL—All items past the cover-ID in the PAT, AAT, or region subclass PAT will be used as a single dissolve item. If there are no items past the cover-ID, then the cover-ID will be used. 
   String 
   feature_type
   (Optional) The feature classes to be preserved in the output coverage:

   POLY —Polygons will be dissolved; an AAT will not be created for the output coverage. This is the default option. 
   LINE —Nodes will be dissolved; a PAT will not be created for the output coverage. 
   NET —Polygons will be dissolved, and both a PAT and AAT will be created for the output coverage. 
   REGION.subclass —Region subclass will be dissolved, and all existing attributes of the input coverage will be maintained in the output coverage. 
    String 

    defaults are as follows:
    
    For the dissolve tool:
